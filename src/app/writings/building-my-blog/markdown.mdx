# Building My Blog

- new year, new blog
- something minimalist
- requirements
  - minimalistic
  - custom Components
  - no external db

- most of heavy lifting is done by nextjs rendering markdown, this autmatiacally allows for importing Components
- there is one tiny teeny problem, where next@mdx doesn't support front matter, which means we can't use regular patternes to create pages
