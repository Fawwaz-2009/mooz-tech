When I first wanted to implement web push notifications, I was overwhelmed by the complexity. What I needed wasn't another implementation guide, but a clear mental model. This article provides that big picture, but it's really meant to complement the [interactive demo](https://web-push-demo.mooz.tech/) that walks you through the implementation.

## A Common Source of Confusion: Notification API vs Push API

Before diving into the architecture, let's clear up something that confused me at first: the difference between the Notification API and Push API. While they sound similar, they serve distinct purposes:

**Notification API**
- Think of it as your "display manager"
- Its main jobs are:
  1. Getting permission from the user to show notifications
  2. Asking the operating system to display notifications
- Without permission from this API, notifications will never show up

**Push API**
- Think of it as your "message receiver"
- Its main jobs are:
  1. Creating an endpoint for your server to send messages to
  2. Receiving messages from your server through the push service
- Even if it receives messages, without Notification API permission, nothing will display

These APIs must work together:
1. Notification API gets permission
2. Push API receives the message
3. Service Worker uses Notification API to display it

## Understanding the Architecture

To understand web push notifications, it helps to break them down into three main areas:
1. What happens in the browser
2. What happens on your server
3. How they communicate (through push services)

## What Happens in the Browser

The browser is where most of the magic happens. It needs to:
- Get permission from the user
- Display notifications
- Run background processes
- Handle incoming messages

This is accomplished through two main APIs:

### 1. Notification API
This is your bridge to the operating system's notification system:
- Shows the permission prompt to the user
- Manages permission state ('default', 'granted', 'denied')
- Handles the actual display of notifications
- Note: The OS has final say - if Do Not Disturb is on, notifications won't show!

### 2. Service Worker
Think of this as your notification manager running in the background:
- Stays active even when your website is closed
- Receives push messages
- Creates and displays the actual notifications
- Handles user interactions (clicks, dismissals)

## What Happens on Your Server

Your server has a simpler but crucial role:
- Stores subscription information for each user
- Decides when to send notifications
- Prepares notification content
- Handles security requirements

The main components here are:

### 1. Subscription Storage
- Each user has a unique subscription object
- Contains the push service endpoint
- Includes encryption keys for secure messaging

### 2. Notification Trigger System
- Determines when to send notifications
- Prepares the notification payload
- Handles retry logic if needed

## How They Communicate: The Push Service Bridge

This is where VAPID (Voluntary Application Server Identification) protocol comes in. It's the secure bridge between your server and the user's browser:

### Push Service
- Each browser vendor runs their own push service
  - Chrome uses Firebase Cloud Messaging
  - Firefox has its own service
  - Safari uses Apple Push Notification service
- Acts as a message broker
- Maintains persistent connections with browsers
- Queues messages when browsers are offline

### VAPID Protocol
This is the security layer that ensures only your server can send notifications to your users:
- Uses public/private key pairs
  - Public key: Used by the browser for subscription
  - Private key: Used by your server to sign messages
- Prevents spam and abuse
- Authenticates your server to the push service

## The Journey of a Push Notification ðŸš€

Before we dive into the details of the flow, let's visualize how all these pieces interact:

![Notification Journey](https://zzjbhpochqhujuvwuots.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/app_public/blog/notification-journey.png)

This diagram shows the complete lifecycle of a push notification, from initial setup to displaying a notification. Let's break down each phase in detail.

## The Flow of a Notification

Now that we can see how the pieces interact, let's examine each phase more closely:

1. **Setup Phase** (One-time)
   - Browser: Requests notification permission
   - Browser: Registers service worker
   - Browser: Gets subscription from push service using your public key
   - Your Server: Stores the subscription

2. **Sending Phase** (Each notification)
   - Your Server: Prepares notification
   - Your Server: Signs with private key
   - Your Server â†’ Push Service: Sends signed message
   - Push Service â†’ Browser: Delivers to correct browser
   - Service Worker: Receives and displays notification

## Common Gotchas and Tips

- **Permissions are permanent** - Once denied, they can only be reset through browser settings
- **Service Worker Scope** - Service workers can only handle notifications for their scope
- **Message Size Limits** - Push services typically limit message sizes (often around 4KB)
- **Offline Handling** - Messages may be queued when users are offline
- **Browser Differences** - Different browsers may handle notifications slightly differently

## Ready to Implement?

Now that you understand where everything happens, head over to our [interactive demo](https://web-push-demo.mooz.tech/) where we'll walk through implementing each piece step by step. The demo provides hands-on experience with:

- Requesting permissions
- Setting up VAPID keys
- Registering service workers
- Creating subscriptions

Understanding these concepts will help you build more robust notification systems and debug issues more effectively when they arise.

## Want to Go Deeper?

While writing this guide, I discovered an incredible resource that goes far beyond what we've covered here: [The Web Push Book](https://web-push-book.gauntface.com/) by Matt Gaunt. If you're interested in diving deeper into web push notifications, It's a fantastic next step after you've got the basics working with our demo.
